    <p>I realised as i thought about what to say in this message that, it is quiet hard, infact even harder than i thought it would be, not beacuase i have nothing to say, but because i don't know how to put all together, 
      i guess the truth is, if you were to ever imagine the precious moments we spent together, your mind will always first run to matric, beacuse that when we truly got to know and spent time together.
    Nevertheless, the time we spent together officially as friends have nothing but a pleasure, despite any arguments or tough times we have been through, you are really worth looking back to and appreciaating, 
  and hope you are worth looking forward to. The journey we had, and are having is an important aspect of our growth, Watching you blossom with my own eyes has been a worth it all,  worth the things i had to cutt off, the things that had to change in me and waking up tired for school. 
I remember you used to get pissed at me when i told you i wasn't coming to school. I guess you really loved seeing me huh... I would have really loved seeing me too. Sometimes i wish i could turn the clock, and have to wake up to see you again, even in that ugly uniform, is still loved seeing your face, your smile and 
or even watching you just go on about your day. The biggest thing of all is, what i want the most is your presence.
 </p>
 <p>And hopefully one day, i get to wake up to it everyday.</p>
