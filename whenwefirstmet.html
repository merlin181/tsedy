    <p>You have always been special, from the way you carried yourself, i could tell there was something about you, from the first time we met. I guesss that is what made me stay, despite our differences 
      and conflicting personalities then. I have probably told you that, i didn't care about anything about you back then, but when i sit and think about it, i can't think of anything other reason why i decided to become your friend.
      Matseliso, you have always been special expecially to me, i have had a lot of ups and downs during those years, but having you has always made feel better. Believe it or not, having you beside me in matric really encouraged me to work 
      harder. I always planned to work hard but with you there, i had more reason to do so, more purpose. I want to make you happy, from the first days of our friendship, i have always loved making you smile and laugh.

    <p>I remember, getting your text this one night and you wanted to know if we are best friends, at first i wanted to say no, but then you were a good friend and i also thought at the time, well i guess there is no harm in being a close
      friend, if only grade 8 me could see first year me typing this message, he would probably flip, him and i had very differnt plans about how we wanted to live our lives, but somehow you managed to influence him, the first year me, apart from other factors, is also a product of your love and care for me.
      You probably might have gone bit too far though, because now there are so many things in my life that, i am sure that even you suprised i don't want or come out of my mouth, and maybe how mature i have grown. I thank God that he put you in my life, you have been nothing but of great
      importanace and value, and i hope i am to you too, i want to be the best influence for you, the best everything for you, because you deserve the best.
    </p>
  </br>
</br>
  <p>Where ever you are, no matter how far, i want to you know that i will always be by your side. I am your bestfreind and a big part of your life just as much you are mine, i will always have your back and i want you remember this in your darkest and happiest days that i love you and i will 
    always will.  </p>
